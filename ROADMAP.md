**Location**: Creator Mode sidebar

**Status**: [⏸️] **BLOCKED** - Depends on Phase 19 (Queue System)

**Current State**: 
- ✅ Image generation uses queue system (GenerationState, WebSocket events)
- ❌ LLM suggestions are synchronous HTTP requests (not queued)
- ❌ No unified queue UI showing both types

**Dependencies**: 
- **REQUIRES Phase 19** - Needs LLMReasoningQueue and AssetGenerationQueue infrastructure

### 2.1d Unified Queue System - Engine Architecture (Phase 19) ⚠️ **CURRENT PRIORITY**

**Plan**: [19-queue-system.md](./19-queue-system.md)  
**Architecture Validation**: [queue_system_architecture_validation.md](./queue_system_architecture_validation.md)  
**Lock Pattern Analysis**: [lock_refactoring_analysis.md](./lock_refactoring_analysis.md)

**Summary**: Implement a comprehensive queue system for all game actions, AI processing, and DM approvals. Provides crash recovery, audit trails, and foundation for scaling. **Solves lock pattern issues** identified in architecture analysis.

**Status**: [ ] Not started - **READY TO IMPLEMENT**

**Why This Is Priority**:
- ✅ Solves critical lock pattern problem (WebSocket handlers can't hold locks across async boundaries)
- ✅ Enables Phase 15 (Generation Queue) and Phase 16 (Decision Queue)
- ✅ Provides crash recovery and audit trails
- ✅ Foundation for scaling to multi-server deployments

**Five Queues**:
| Queue | Purpose | Persistence | Current State |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `PlayerActionQueue` | Player actions awaiting processing | Yes | ❌ Not implemented |
| `DMActionQueue` | DM actions awaiting processing | Yes | ❌ Not implemented |
| `LLMReasoningQueue` | Ollama requests (BATCH_SIZE controlled) | Optional | ❌ Not implemented |
| `AssetGenerationQueue` | ComfyUI requests (BATCH_SIZE=1) | Optional | ⚠️ Partial (GenerationService uses HashMap) |
| `DMApprovalQueue` | Decisions awaiting DM approval | Yes | ⚠️ Partial (uses in-memory HashMap) |

**Key Features**:
- Hexagonal architecture with pluggable backends (InMemory, SQLite, Redis)
- Crash recovery via persistent queues
- Audit trail for all actions
- Concurrency control (BATCH_SIZE) for AI services
- History tracking for approvals
- **Solves lock pattern**: WebSocket handlers enqueue and return immediately

**Current Services to Refactor**:
- `PlayerActionService` - Currently uses problematic lock pattern, needs queue integration
- `ApprovalService` - Currently uses in-memory HashMap, needs DMApprovalQueue
- `GenerationService` - Currently uses in-memory HashMap, needs AssetGenerationQueue
- `websocket.rs` - Contains orchestration (Phase 18.2.3), will be refactored in Phase 19C

**Dependencies**:
- ✅ No blockers - can start immediately

## TIER 3: ARCHITECTURE & QUALITY

### 3.0 Engine Architecture Remediation (Phase 18.2)

**Location**: `Engine/src/infrastructure/websocket.rs`, `Engine/src/application/services/`

**Context**: WebSocket adapter contains application orchestration. This violates hexagonal architecture principles.

**Status**: [⏸️] **MERGED INTO Phase 19C** - WebSocket refactoring will be completed as part of Phase 19C (Queue System Integration)

**Current State**:
- ✅ Phase 18.2.1-18.2.2 Complete: SessionManagementPort, PlayerActionService, ApprovalService created
- ✅ Phase 18.2.3 Partial: Ports implemented on SessionManager
- ⏸️ Phase 18.2.3 Remaining: WebSocket handler refactoring **deferred to Phase 19C**

**Why Merged with Phase 19**:
- Phase 19 queue system solves the lock pattern problem that blocked Phase 18.2.3
- WebSocket refactoring requires queue infrastructure anyway
- More efficient to do both together

**What Will Be Done in Phase 19C**:
- Refactor `websocket.rs` to use queue services
- Remove orchestration from WebSocket adapter
- WebSocket becomes thin adapter: parse → enqueue → return
- Worker tasks handle processing (no locks held across async boundaries)

**Reference**: See `architecture_plan.md` Phase 18.2 and `lock_refactoring_analysis.md`

### 4.4 Story Arc (Both) - Phase 17

**Location**: Engine domain + Player views (new Story Arc tab)

**Plan Document**: `plans/17-story-arc.md`
